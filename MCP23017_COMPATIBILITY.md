# MCP23017 Software Emulation Compatibility Guide

> **DEPRECATED (Rev 10.0 — February 2026):** The MCP23017 I2C slave emulation was **completely removed** in Rev 10.0. The ESP32 is now the I2C master (reading its own ADS1015 ADC) and all relay control is handled via serial JSON commands from the Linux device. This document is preserved for historical reference only. It does NOT apply to Rev 10.0 or later firmware.

## Overview (Historical — Rev 9.x Only)

The Walter IO Board Firmware (Rev 9.1 through 9.4f) included a software emulation of the Microchip MCP23017 16-bit I/O Expander. This document describes the emulation's compatibility with the physical chip, limitations, and recommendations for client software.

## Port A - Relay Outputs (GPIOA / 0x12)

Port A controls 5 relay outputs mapped to ESP32 GPIO pins:

| Bit | MCP Pin | ESP32 GPIO | Function | Description |
|-----|---------|------------|----------|-------------|
| 0 | GPA0 | GPIO 11 | Motor | Vacuum Pump Motor |
| 1 | GPA1 | GPIO 18 | CR1 | Relay 1 |
| 2 | GPA2 | GPIO 17 | CR2 | Relay 2 |
| 3 | GPA3 | GPIO 16 | CR5 | Relay 5 |
| 4 | GPA4 | GPIO 13 | V6 | Valve 6 Relay |
| 5-7 | GPA5-7 | N/A | Unused | Always read as 0 |

### Writing to GPIOA (0x12)

```c
// Example: Turn on Motor (bit 0) and CR1 (bit 1)
// Write 0x03 to register 0x12
i2c_write(0x20, 0x12, 0x03);

// Example: All relays OFF
i2c_write(0x20, 0x12, 0x00);

// Example: Predefined patterns
// IDLE:  0x00 (all off)
// RUN:   0x0B (Motor + CR1 + CR5)
// PURGE: 0x05 (Motor + CR2)
// BURP:  0x08 (CR5 only)
```

---

## Port B - Overfill Input (GPIOB / 0x13)

Port B bit 0 is configured as an **input** connected to the overfill sensor:

| Bit | MCP Pin | ESP32 GPIO | Function | Description |
|-----|---------|------------|----------|-------------|
| 0 | GPB0 | GPIO 38 | Overfill | Active LOW = Alarm |
| 1-7 | GPB1-7 | N/A | Unused | Always read as 0 |

### Reading GPIOB (0x13)

```c
// Read overfill status
uint8_t status = i2c_read(0x20, 0x13);
if (status & 0x01) {
    // Overfill alarm ACTIVE
}
```

**Note:** The overfill input has built-in debouncing (5 consecutive LOW readings required to trigger alarm).

## Differences from Physical MCP23017

### 1. Default IODIR Values

| Register | Real MCP23017 | This Emulator |
|----------|---------------|---------------|
| IODIRA | 0xFF (all inputs) | **0x00 (all outputs)** |
| IODIRB | 0xFF (all inputs) | **0x01 (bit0 input)** |

**Why:** Our application uses Port A for relay outputs and only bit 0 of Port B for input.

### 2. BANK Mode

- **Real chip:** Supports BANK=0 and BANK=1 addressing modes
- **Emulator:** **Only BANK=0 is supported**
- Attempting to set BANK=1 in IOCON will be ignored

### 3. Interrupt Pins (INTA/INTB)

- **Real chip:** Physical interrupt output pins
- **Emulator:** Interrupt registers are emulated but **no physical interrupt pins**
- Software can still poll INTFA/INTFB registers

### 4. Pull-up Resistors (GPPU)

- **Real chip:** Internal 100kΩ pull-ups
- **Emulator:** GPPUA/GPPUB registers are stored but **pull-ups not physically active**
- External pull-ups should be used if needed

### 5. Sequential Operation (SEQOP)

- **Real chip:** SEQOP=0 enables address auto-increment, SEQOP=1 disables
- **Emulator:** SEQOP=0 mode fully supported, SEQOP=1 supported

## I2C Transaction Examples

### Basic Write (Set Register, Then Data)

```c
// Turn on Motor relay (bit 0 of GPIOA)
uint8_t data[2] = {0x12, 0x01};  // Register, Value
i2c_write_bytes(0x20, data, 2);
```

### Basic Read (Set Register Pointer, Then Read)

```c
// Read GPIOA
i2c_write_byte(0x20, 0x12);       // Set register pointer
uint8_t value = i2c_read_byte(0x20);  // Read value
```

### Sequential Write (Multiple Registers)

```c
// Write to GPIOA (0x12) and GPIOB (0x13) in one transaction
uint8_t data[3] = {0x12, 0x0B, 0x00};  // Start at GPIOA, then GPIOB
i2c_write_bytes(0x20, data, 3);
```

### Linux i2c-tools Examples

```bash
# Read all relay states (GPIOA)
i2cget -y 1 0x20 0x12

# Set relays (Motor + CR1 = 0x03)
i2cset -y 1 0x20 0x12 0x03

# Read overfill sensor (GPIOB)
i2cget -y 1 0x20 0x13

# Read IOCON register
i2cget -y 1 0x20 0x0A

# Dump all registers
i2cdump -y 1 0x20
```

## Noisy I2C Bus Handling

The emulator includes error detection for noisy I2C environments:

### Built-in Protections

1. **Invalid Register Detection:** Addresses > 0x15 are rejected
2. **Empty Transaction Detection:** Zero-byte transactions increment error counter
3. **Transaction Counting:** Tracks total transactions and errors for diagnostics

### Diagnostic Variables (Available via Web API)

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `i2cTransactionCount` | Total I2C transactions processed |
| `i2cErrorCount` | Transactions with errors detected |
| `i2cLastGoodTransaction` | Timestamp of last successful transaction |

### Enabling Debug Logging

Set `i2cDebugEnabled = true` in code to enable verbose I2C logging:

```
I2C WRITE: Reg 0x12 = 0x0B
I2C READ: Reg 0x12 = 0x0B
I2C ERROR: Invalid register 0x1F
```

### Recommendations for Noisy Environments

1. **Use proper I2C pull-ups** (4.7kΩ typical)
2. **Keep I2C wires short** (< 50cm recommended)
3. **Use twisted pair or shielded cable** for SDA/SCL
4. **Avoid routing I2C near high-current relay wiring**
5. **Add decoupling capacitors** near the I2C bus
6. **Implement retry logic** in master software:

```c
// Example retry logic
int retries = 3;
while (retries-- > 0) {
    if (i2c_write(0x20, 0x12, value) == 0) {
        break;  // Success
    }
    usleep(1000);  // Wait 1ms before retry
}
```

---

## Web Override Behavior

**Important:** The web interface can temporarily override I2C relay commands:

- When user interacts with web interface, a 5-second override is activated
- During override, I2C writes to GPIOA are **ignored**
- After 5 seconds of web inactivity, I2C control resumes

This prevents conflicts between web and I2C control sources.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Master Software Won't Communicate

1. **Verify I2C address:** Must be 0x20
2. **Check bus speed:** Use 100kHz (standard mode)
3. **Verify wiring:** SDA to GPIO 4, SCL to GPIO 5
4. **Check pull-ups:** Need external pull-ups on SDA/SCL

### Relays Not Responding to I2C Commands

1. **Check web override:** Wait 5 seconds after last web interaction
2. **Verify register address:** Use 0x12 (GPIOA) not 0x14 (OLATA) - both work
3. **Check bit mapping:** Bit 0 = Motor, Bit 1 = CR1, etc.

### Wrong Values Read Back

1. **Check IPOL registers:** Non-zero IPOL inverts read values
2. **Verify IODIR:** Outputs read back the output latch value
3. **Check BANK mode:** Only BANK=0 is supported

### I2C Errors in Noisy Environment

1. Enable debug logging to identify error patterns
2. Check Web API for error counts: `/api/status` includes `i2cErrors`
3. Implement retry logic in master software
4. Improve physical I2C bus integrity

## Known Issues Fixed

### BlueCherry Restart Loop (Fixed in 9.1d)
**Symptom:** System reboots every 15-30 minutes during BlueCherry platform outages
**Cause:** When BlueCherry sync failed, code called `modem.reset()` which disconnected LTE. On next `loop()` iteration, LTE check failed and triggered `ESP.restart()`.
**Fix:** 
- Removed `modem.reset()` and `lteConnect()` from BlueCherry sync failure path
- System now marks BlueCherry as disconnected and continues running
- Added fault code 4096 to alert users when BlueCherry is offline
- Weekly restart still occurs if BlueCherry never connects (for OTA retry)

### I2C Timeout Error (Fixed in 9.1c)
**Symptom:** `OSError: [Errno 5] Input/output error` on Linux master
**Cause:** Mutex timeouts in I2C callbacks were 50-100ms, but I2C slave must respond in microseconds
**Fix:** 
- Reduced all I2C callback mutex timeouts to 1ms maximum
- Added fallback behavior: if mutex unavailable, proceed with cached/direct value
- I2C bus no longer times out waiting for firmware response

### Relay Read-Back Mismatch (Fixed in 9.1b)
**Symptom:** Master writes value to GPIOA, reads back different value
**Cause:** Race condition - gpioA_value was written without mutex protection
**Fix:** All writes to gpioA_value now use mutex synchronization

### Spurious Overfill Alarms (Fixed in 9.1b)
**Symptom:** Overfill alarm triggering randomly
**Cause:** 
1. Input pin configured without pull-up (floating when sensor disconnected)
2. Single HIGH reading immediately cleared alarm (no hysteresis)
**Fix:** 
1. Added INPUT_PULLUP to GPIO38
2. Alarm now requires 3 consecutive HIGH readings to clear (hysteresis)
